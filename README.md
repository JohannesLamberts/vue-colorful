# Vue.js lightweight introduction

This repository was originally created for a Meetup lightning talk (https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Hamburg-Education-Technology-Meetup/events/cwdfhpyzcbtb/).

It shows, how easy it is to work with Vue.js even without webpack etc.

The commits show, step by step, the main features of any Vue component:
- 0 - data
- 1 - computed & reactivity
- 2 - methods
- 3 - hooks & lifecycle (mounted, destroyed)
- 4 - reusability


Feel free to fork, play around and experiment with Vue.js!

While Vue.js is easy to use as shown here it is yet powerful for large-scale applications.
